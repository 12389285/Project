## Terrorism incidents in the world

## Problem set  
Over the years there are more terrorist attacks then there are used to be. I want to do a research on the amount of incidents, fatal and non fatal of terrorism.

_Which country has the most terrorism incidents in the world?_

## Solution

I want to create a website where it is possible to see all kind of graphics with the use of line charts, bar charts and a world map of the amount of terrorism incidents in the world between 1970 and 2017.

In this problem set I want to visualize:
1) A world map with the number of incidents per year (MVP).
2) A line chart with the the total of incidents over all the years (MVP).
3) A line chart with the fatal incidents. (MVP)
4) A line chart with the non fatal incidents. (MVP)
5) A bar chart showing the fatal and non fatal per year. (optional)
6) A bar chart with all years per country.

## Prerequisites

* The data I am using I found on the internet are 3 CSV files, converted to JSON.
  1) Terrorism incidents
  2) Fatal incidents
  3) Non fatal incidents

* The libraries I think of using:
  * d3
  * matplotlib
  * SQlite

* The hardest parts of implementing are:
  * The world map
  * Updating the map and other charts
