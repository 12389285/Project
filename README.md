# Proposal project january 2019  

## Problem set  
The problem I would like to solve is a visualization of the number and
information of airplane crashes over a period 1908 - 2009.  

_Which country has the most fatal aircraft accidents in the history?_

## Solution

I want to create a website where it is possible to see all kind of graphics
with the use of line charts, bar charts and a world map.

In this problem set I want to visualize:
1) The number of crashes per location,
2) The operator/airline
3) The type of the aircraft
4) Number of people aboard
5) The number of fatalities
